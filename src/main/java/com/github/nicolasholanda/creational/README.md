# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, enhancing flexibility and reuse.

## Patterns Summary

### 1. Abstract Factory  
Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- **Example**: UI toolkit that generates buttons and text fields for different operating systems.

### 2. Builder  
Constructs complex objects step by step, allowing different configurations.  
- **Example**: Configuring a customizable car order.

### 3. Factory Method  
Defines a method for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Example**: Document editor that creates different document types (Word, PDF).

### 4. Prototype  
Creates new objects by copying an existing instance, avoiding costly instantiation.  
- **Example**: Cloning game characters with predefined attributes.

### 5. Singleton  
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
- **Example**: Database connection manager.
